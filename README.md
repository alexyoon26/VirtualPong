**VirtualPong** is a virtual (!= beer) pong simulation powered by **OpenCV**, tracking the player's hand movements using a stereo camera system to accurately portray the desired movement. The graphical elements are simulated using **vpython**, modeling the 3D demonstration of a pong table on a virtual environment.
